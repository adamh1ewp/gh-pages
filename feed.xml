                <p>i just realise that i was extremely successful always in my class, i am like crazy good, </p>
<p>the whole year i would never study and at the last day , i would  just memorize the whole lesson and book with my  photographic memory and with the help of personalised tests that my mother created  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> i never appreaciated and understood the  opportunities that she has given me , the power and the way that she has built for me and i just have to now belive on something good and follow it  and she trained and give my brain the best tools that enabled me to do anything  but i used my physicality in secretly masturbating daily and became a bad and scared person and that is really sad </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>but i ruined it all </p>
<p>while all the other boys were open </p>
