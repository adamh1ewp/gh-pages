                <p>This is my personal site which is hosted on the github , i can say whatever i want here  and   i am not scared of anything </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>_______________<br>today i had a thought of creating a  app for the voting and the election system in india and that would be really awesome would not it be</p>
<p>two things</p>
<p>* somebody must have thought this before </p>
<p>* this would not be easy to get the accurate data</p>
<p>* there would be leaders  who would try to fight it</p>
<p>* the goverment would probably buy and take over it </p>
<p>____________________</p>
<p>also </p>
<p>today i am in love with bella poarch , almost daily i find a new girl i am in love with   like someday earlier it was lovelynnbooo, </p>
<p> the way they are happy and smile it is amazing , but i can't really approach any girl until / untless i have a build  a name for myself and made my mother a home and  reputation ,that is what i have been forced upon in my education and belief system and it is really hard to fight  it is some kind o hypnosis that i am in  , that i cannot openly do things that make me happy as i am scared of waht my family would think that i am a bad person who just cares about himself, and do not has any consideration for the family and that is why i can not do anything i want </p>
